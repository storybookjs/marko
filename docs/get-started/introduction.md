title: 'Introduction to Storybook'

Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can develop entire UIs without needing to start up a complex dev stack, force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.

Use Storybook to build small atomic components and complex pages in your web application. If it's a UI, you can build it with Storybook.

Storybook helps you **document** components for reuse and automatically **visually test** your components to prevent bugs. Extend Storybook with an ecosystem of **addons** that help you do things like fine-tune responsive layouts or verify accessibility.

Storybook integrates with most popular JavaScript UI frameworks and (experimentally) supports server-rendered component frameworks such as [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).
